"""
Test that demonstrates the fix for ConflictError during arbiter startup.

The issue: During arbiter initialization, start_watchers() is called. If a client
sends a "start" command at the same time, it gets ConflictError because
start_watchers is already running.

The fix: Make start_watchers check if watchers are already running before
trying to start them. This makes the operation more idempotent.

        # 3. But if a client sends "start" after init completes, it sees all watchers
        #    are already running and returns quickly without doing anything
        # 4. This reduces the window for ConflictError significantly
